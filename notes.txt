[ ] picture first, then about underneath
	- idk what I think about this from a layout point of view
[x] gallery - description underneath
[x] grey tint on hover on buttons, white text with name and date
[x] colors
[ ] make it mobile friendly! notes on github issue
[x] use models to finish the rest of the galleries
	- replace special characters with html entities
[ ] better quality images for inside the modals
	- they should all be the size of the diploma photos
	- how do you only load these if the modal gets opened?
	- i'm not truly sure how important this is... let's ask sarah

things that just need touching up:
	[ ] sizing of modal descriptions
		- i think jesuitana is the longest one, so as long as that one
		  fits we're golden
	[ ] test on different devices
		- iphone
		- ipad
		- adam's phone
		- desktop 

things I need from Sarah:
- dates for 
	- other
	- bookmarks
	- de bello belgico
- descriptions for 
	- other
- are treatment reports something people might want to see?
	- link to em in the gallery description
- a good email
- a good phone number
- possibly a different way to contact, if she wants
- what does she think of the photo quality?
