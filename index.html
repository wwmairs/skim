                        <p>Sarah Kim was born in Seoul, South Korea and moved to the United States on her sixth birthday. She was raised in the suburbs of southern New Hampshire, left for Syracuse, NY to attend college, and now she currently resides in Boston, MA.</p>
                        <p>In 2009, she started college at Syracuse University and first declared a major in Fashion Design, and transitioned into Communications Design. Initially, she wanted to study in the creative field, but the different circumstances of life has led her to graduate with a B.A. in Psychology. Through her many shifts in college, she found stability and a growing passion working at the university library’s Preservation Department repairing books. A year after graduation, she was hired at the library not only to continue repairing books, but also to train and work with students, and contribute to workshops and teaching opportunities.</p>
                        <p>In the spring of 2016, she decided to apply and was accepted to the Bookbinding program at the North Bennet Street School in Boston. She wants to continue pursuing her passion by getting the formal training in not just book repair, but in all aspects of bookbinding. She will be a certified bookbinder by June 2018.</p>
